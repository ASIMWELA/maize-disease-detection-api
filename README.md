# MAIZE DISEASE DETECTION API

Allows a user to send and an image to an for a diseased maize leaf and get the results predicted by the underlying model. The API also has a community section which 
alloow users to create issues when the model fails to confidenctly detect a disease. The section however doesnt not exclude other crops i.e. a user can directly create 
an issue regardless of whether is a maize crop or any crop. The issues are attended to by remote experts. Detecting a disease does not require an account but community interraction
requires a user to create an account.
